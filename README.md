# Front Loader

Front Loader is a (VERY) basic python script that I wrote to speed up my login times.

During the Mac Login, OS X will load all of the Applications in Login Items. These all happen at once even though I don't actually need them all right away.

Front Loader uses a config file to allow you to specify the order in which the Login Items run.

During startup, Front Loader will run, and delay between the startup of the Login Items so that you have a responsive system during the login process.

## Installation

Front Loader relies on PyYaml so you need to install this first.
